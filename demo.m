% DEMO script for frontalizing faces, based on the method described in [1]
% This demo produces a frontalized face for the image test.jpg
%
% If you find this code useful and use it in your own work, please add
% reference to [1] and, if appropriate, any of the other papers mentioned below.
%
% Dependencies: 
%   The demo uses the following dependencies. You MUST have these installed and
%   available on the MATLAB path:
%   1. calib function available from [2,3], required for estimating the query
%       camera projection matrix, C_Q. Calib functions are assumed to be
%       under folder <frontalization>/calib
%   2. Facial feature detection functions. The demo provides examples
%       showing frontalization results obtained using the SDM method [4] 
%       (default used in the paper), the facial feature detector of Zhu and 
%       Ramanan [5], or the dlib detector (Kazemi and Sullivan) [6]. Please see
%       the script facial_feature_detection.m on how to use these (as well as 
%       edit paths to the detector used in practice, in case these differ from 
%       the ones in the script). See the function makeNew3DModel.m in case
%       a different facial feature detector is used.
%   3. OpenCV required by calib for calibration routines and some of the
%       detectors for cascase classifiers (e.g., SDM)
